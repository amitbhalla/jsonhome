        "question": "What makes your approach different from other marketing consultants?",
        "answer": "<p>Three key differentiators set me apart:</p><p>First, my experience at top consulting firms like BCG and McKinsey has ingrained a rigorous, analytical approach that's uncommon in marketing. I leverage data to drive decisions rather than gut feelings.</p><p>Second, I focus on the entire customer journey rather than isolated tactics. This holistic view ensures all marketing activities work together to guide prospects from awareness to purchase.</p><p>Third, I bridge the gap between strategy and execution—creating plans that are ambitious yet practical to implement. I'm not interested in theoretical strategies that look good in presentations but fall apart in the real world.</p>"
